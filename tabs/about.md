Hey all, I am a network and security Enthusiast. 

I've switched from working as Navigational Officer in Merchant Navy to IT specifically Network Engineering. So i encourage people that doubt in themselves about career change, work hard and just do it, everything is possible!

I currently hold a couple of Networking Certificates including:

Cisco CCNP Enterprise

Mikrotik (MTCNA)

Sonicwall Network Security Administrator

Cambium Enterprise WiFi 

Dell Networking Associate

I've decided to write about stuff as i learn and progress in my career. Hope you like the content and that you learn something.
